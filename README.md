# Braille Image Translation and Text-to-Speech Conversion

## Overview
This repository hosts our graduation project, focused on the development of a system that utilizes image processing and deep learning techniques to facilitate the translation of scanned Braille images into English text. Additionally, the system seamlessly converts the extracted text into audible speech, enhancing accessibility for visually impaired individuals.
