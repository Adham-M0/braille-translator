# Braille Image Translation and Text-to-Speech Conversion

## Overview
This repository hosts our graduation project, focused on the development of a system that utilizes image processing and deep learning techniques to facilitate the translation of scanned Braille images into English text. Additionally, the system seamlessly converts the extracted text into audible speech, enhancing accessibility for visually impaired individuals.

## Project Description
This project aims to bridge the gap between Braille literacy and accessibility through the integration of cutting-edge technologies. Leveraging the power of image processing and deep learning, the system provides a robust solution capable of accurately interpreting Braille characters from scanned images. The system achieved high levels of accuracy in Braille image translation.

Furthermore, the project extends beyond mere text extraction by incorporating a text-to-speech conversion step. By synthesizing the extracted English text into audible speech, the system empowers individuals with visual impairments to access Braille content effortlessly. Our project is focused on translating grade 1 and grade 2 front-only scanned Braille images. The summary of the project is shown in the figure below.
